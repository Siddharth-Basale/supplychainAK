## What is This Platform?

This is a **Supply Chain Management Platform** that connects manufacturers (companies that make products) with suppliers (companies that provide raw materials or components). Think of it as a marketplace where:

- **Manufacturers** can post what they need and receive competitive bids from multiple suppliers
- **Suppliers** can find opportunities to supply products and submit their best offers
- Both parties can negotiate terms, track deliveries, and build trusted business relationships

### The Problem It Solves

Traditionally, finding the right supplier involves:
- Making many phone calls and emails
- Comparing prices manually
- Limited visibility into supplier reliability
- Time-consuming negotiations
- Difficulty tracking environmental impact

**This platform solves all of these problems** by providing a centralized, digital marketplace with built-in tools for comparison, negotiation, and sustainability tracking.

## Understanding Carbon Footprint

### What is Carbon Footprint?

Your **carbon footprint** is the total amount of greenhouse gases (especially CO2) produced by your activities. In shipping, this comes from:
- Fuel burned by vehicles
- Distance traveled
- Vehicle type and efficiency
- Load capacity utilization

### Why It Matters

- **Environmental Impact:** Shipping contributes to climate change
- **Corporate Responsibility:** Many companies want to reduce their impact
- **Cost Implications:** Lower emissions often mean lower fuel costs
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Some regions have carbon regulations

### How the Calculator Works

**Inputs Required:**
- **Start Address:** Where shipment begins
- **End Address:** Where shipment goes
- **Vehicle Type:**
  - Small Truck (3.5-7.5 tons)
  - Medium Truck (7.5-16 tons)
  - Large Truck (16-32 tons)
  - Articulated Truck (>32 tons)
- **Vehicle Count:** How many vehicles
- **Load Percentage:** How full (1-100%)
- **Empty Return:** Will vehicle return empty?

**What You Get:**
- **Distance:** Total kilometers
- **Total Emissions:** CO2 in kilograms
- **Per Vehicle:** Emissions per vehicle
- **Tree Equivalent:** How many trees needed to offset

### Making Sustainable Choices

**Tips:**
1. **Optimize Routes:** Shorter routes = less emissions
2. **Maximize Load:** Full trucks are more efficient
3. **Choose Efficient Vehicles:** Right size for the job
4. **Consider Air vs. Road:** Air is faster but produces more emissions
5. **Plan Returns:** Avoid empty return trips when possible
